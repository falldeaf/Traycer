# Traycer HUD Documentation

Welcome to the Traycer HUD documentation set. These pages cover the essentials for installing, configuring, and extending the Traycer overlay.

- **Getting Started** – install the HUD, configure the defaults file, and learn tray controls.
- **IPC JSON Protocol** – reference the messages available over the named pipe.
- **Defaults Configuration** – understand how Traycer discovers and parses `traycer.defaults.json`.
- **Background Tasks** – manage scheduled and one-off jobs controlled through the tray.
- **Custom Script Tutorial** – build timer jobs and long-lived daemons that push well updates.
- **API Reference** – explore public types generated from the codebase.
